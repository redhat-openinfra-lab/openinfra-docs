## Introduction

For security purposes, all administrative and root logins are kept in BitWarden for safe keeping.  This is an enterprise approved password management application.  BitWarden is integrated with Red Hat Rover Groups for access management.

### Red Hat Rover Groups

You can find Rover Groups in the <a href="https://rover.redhat.com/apps/ target="_blank"> Rover </a>application.  In the Search bar, enter groups.  

Access <a href="https://rover.redhat.com/groups/" target="_blank"> Rover Groups </a>; the main page will display your group membership.  The `na-ssa-infrastructure` group is the group used for BitWarden membership.  Current owners of the group are Ken, Chris, and Peter.  They can help with any membership additions and deletions.

## BitWarden

<a href="https://vault.bitwarden.com/#/login" target="_blank">BitWarden </a> can be access via your favorite browser.  If necessary create an account using your @redhat.com email address.  

The *Na Ssa Infrastructure* Collection has all of the lab's passwords, keys, and secrets.  You can create your own Folders to organize the secrets.  Keep in mind, the *Folders* are only available to you.  They are not shared folders with the *na-ssa-infrastructure* group, just the collection is shared.  Feel free to organize however you want.
